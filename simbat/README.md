## Simbat

I hacked this all up in small coding sessions here and
there. I wanted to give a shot to monodevelop and remind
myself a little about C#. 

This is a very simple implementation of common patterns such
as controllers, commands, mappers, tdgs, and a little (maybe
not so) creative ideas of my own. 

The application when done should allow you to battle against
monsters, text based, in rpg fashion. Basically about grinding.

In the future, if I've got nothing better to do, I'm going to
implement something like a server where you can connect and
grind on from a bunch of different clients. It should be fun.
If that happens, the current (simple) architecture would be 
able to sustain such a decision. 

Oh I'm using mono, and there's some dependencies for SQLite 
for the moment - so I'm not guaranteeing that it will work 
with Microsoft stuffs. Yep.
